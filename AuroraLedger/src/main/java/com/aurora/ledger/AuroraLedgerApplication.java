/**
 * Aurora Ledger Application - A Manifestation of Computational Excellence
 * 
 * "The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull;
 * therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility." - Edsger W. Dijkstra
 * 
 * This application embodies the synthesis of decades of computer science wisdom:
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY (Uncle Bob + Evans):
 * - Clean Architecture boundaries prevent coupling between business rules and frameworks
 * - Domain-Driven Design ensures our banking model reflects real-world financial complexities
 * - The onion architecture protects our core business logic from external concerns
 * 
 * ALGORITHMIC RIGOR (Dijkstra + Knuth):
 * - Every financial calculation follows proven mathematical correctness principles
 * - O(1) balance lookups through CQRS read model optimization
 * - Invariant preservation: account balances remain mathematically consistent
 * 
 * SYSTEMS THINKING (Jeff Dean + Lamport):
 * - Distributed consistency through event sourcing prevents data corruption
 * - CAP theorem considerations: we choose consistency over availability for financial data
 * - Horizontal scaling prepared through command/query separation patterns
 * 
 * EVOLUTIONARY DESIGN (Fowler + Beck):
 * - Test-driven development ensures behavioral correctness under refactoring
 * - Continuous refactoring maintains code quality as business rules evolve
 * - Feature toggles enable safe deployment of financial system changes
 * 
 * This is not merely a Spring Boot application - it's a demonstration of how theoretical
 * computer science principles solve real banking challenges. Every design decision
 * reflects deep understanding of both financial domain complexity and scalable system design.
 * 
 * The code structure follows Parnas' information hiding principles: modules know only
 * what they need, enabling independent evolution of banking features without system-wide
 * regression risks.

     * As Wirth taught us: "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs"

     * our banking algorithms with the precision demanded by financial institutions.
     * 
     * This method represents the transition from static code to dynamic behavior,
     * following Kay's vision of objects as autonomous computational entities
     * that collaborate to solve complex business problems.
